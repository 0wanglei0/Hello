BLOB是一个二进制大对象，可以容纳可变数量的数据。有4种BLOB类型：TINYBLOB、BLOB、MEDIUMBLOB和LONGBLOB。它们只是可容纳值的最大长度不同。

A binary large object that can hold a variable amount of binary data. The sorting and comparison of the values for these objects is performed in case-sensitive manner.


TINYBLOB


A binary large object column with a maximum length of 255 (2^8 - 1) characters.


BLOB


A binary large object column with a maximum length of 65535 (2^16 - 1) characters.


MEDIUMBLOB


A binary large object column with a maximum length of 16777215 (2^24 - 1) characters.


LONGBLOB
